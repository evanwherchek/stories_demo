# Stories Demo

This demo is a redesign of Instagram stories inspired by a video by Juxtaposed on YouTube about improving the app's UI design. Instead of a single ring around the profile picture of a user indicating their story, the redesign brings a segmented ring that shows how many items are in the user's story(e.g. if there are three story items, the ring is made up of three segments). When a story item is viewed, it's respective segment turns to a faded color to indicate that it has already been viewed.
