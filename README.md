# Stories Demo

This demo is a redesign of Instagram stories inspired by a [video by Juxtaposed on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtffucAmM78) about improving the app's UI. Instead of a single ring around the profile picture of a user indicating their story, the redesign brings a segmented ring that shows how many items are in the user's story(e.g. if there are three story items, the ring is made up of three segments). When a story item is viewed, it's respective segment turns to a faded color to indicate that it has already been viewed.
